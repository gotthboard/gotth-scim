# MIT License Verification

Status: ready for admission

The owner selected MIT on 2026-09-13. The bounded implementation commit is
`59f0239c51742f37b9ed2a2b1b46a7eaf2fec0ee`.

## Verification

- `workflow.toml` parsed successfully with Python 3 `tomllib`.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Exact stale no-license scans passed outside preserved historical evidence.
- The canonical MIT permission and warranty paragraphs occur exactly once.
- On `development`, `make verify` passed with Go 1.26.6, `go vet`, race
  testing, and the required 90.1% statement coverage gate.
- Review accepted the change with the constraint that it create no tag or
  release.

The remaining admission gate is exact Forgejo/GitHub parity after merge. The
first immutable version tag and GitHub release remain separate release work.
